Dear <%= @resource.full_name %>,

Congratulations on embarking on this journey to get our struggling students to be successful readers.

To ensure each child is well supported, we need to track their progress. We're happy to share with you this platform to make recording and tracking their results easy for you.

Please go to <%= link_to('this link', accept_facilitator_invitation_url(invitation_token: @token)) %> to register yourself and your class. This invitation will expire on <%= l(@resource.invitation_due_at, format: :'devise.mailer.invitation_instructions.accept_until_format') %>.

Thank you.

From,
The MYReaders Team
